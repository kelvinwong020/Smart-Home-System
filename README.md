# Description
In this project, we built an IOT(Internet Of Things) system that utilizes STM32F103 development boards to control an array of sensors and devices. This systems contains 4 major components: room monitoring, automatic brightness control, automatic temperature control, and control over WLAN. The project aims to provide a suite of centralized electronic devices that can improve the quality of life within a household. Originally, the system was intended to have a door lock control system and a mobile application for remote control. But due to budget and time constraints, these components was reduced to room monitoring and web server instead.

The technology used for this project are: C, I2C, UART, SPI, GPIO, STLink, STM32

IDE Utilized: Keli V5, STM32CubeMX
